# NOGGIN
NASA Open-access Geo-Gridding Infrastructure

[NASA Open-access Geo-Gridding Infrastructure](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/access/noggin)
was a NASA Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth System
Science (ACCESS-2015), Principal Investigator: Thomas Clune, NASA/GSFC.

NOGGIN/Krige was developed to explore Kriging as a means to
interpolate low-level NASA remote sensing observations to arbitrary
points or grids.

Examples of usage are available in the comments of
Krige/noggin_krige.py.

An example of how to run the code is provided in *run.sh*.


## Notable Dependencies

NOGGIN/Krige depends on the idiosyncratic *master_noggin* branch of the
[fork](https://github.com/michaelleerilee/PyKrige) of
[PyKrige](https://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/PyKrige).
